# Agenda

### Current

- Figures -- many boxes along route remove ECT (1) bit, but restore before going outside of AS

- Implemented both check for ECN and L4S, L4S only requires IP layer ToS bits set

### Upcoming

* IETF workshop agenda
- Continuing measuring L4S:
  
  - Testbed ([GitHub - L4STeam/l4sdemo at 5.4](https://github.com/L4STeam/l4sdemo/tree/5.4))
    
    - Test L4S on various congestion control algorithms and AQMs
  
  - Vagrantfile for TCP Prague ([GitHub - larseggert/l4s-box: A Vagrant box running an L4S kernel, with mininet installed](https://github.com/larseggert/l4s-box))
  
  - Mentioned can use traceroute connection to test for L4S by sending packets/measuring time, how to do this? Ideally want another host downstream of host you're testing, but not sure if this is possible?

# Notes

Building on original traceroute, explicitly specify each node on route and ping directly to check if ECN preserved?

# TODO

Read Netalyzer paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1879141.1879173), ZMap paper (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity13/sec13-paper_durumeric.pdf)

Start thinking about how to scale up measurements/data collection

Try sending 1) packets with L4S bits set and 2) control/classic packets to "green" nodes and attempt to measure if they are L4S compatible

#### IP Layer

If a router can support setting ECN bits in IP header, is it required to?

Steps to verify IP layer:

* If upstream preserves, but current node does not, then not supported

* If upstream does not preserve, and current node does, then supported and deployed

* If upstream does not preserve and current node does not, then not deploying, but unknown supported
  
  * If you can somehow route to current node through different parent node that preserves bits and check if bits are preserved

#### TCP Layer
