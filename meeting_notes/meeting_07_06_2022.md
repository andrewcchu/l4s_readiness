### Current

- Measuring RTT:
  
  - Tried using the `tcpopt` field to set timing information, hosts did not reply back/set these fields with any update
  - Current: local time measurements (e.g., time taken at time of send, time taken at time of recv, calc. difference)
    - However this is not very precise/haven't found a L4S host to measure against (to see the difference between L4S and classic traffic)

- Doubtful of the readiness of L4S at scale --> if we find very few hosts that support L4S, will not have much to write about?

- How do we define readiness? (Capability? Deployment? Configuration?)

### Upcoming/Planned TODO

- Attend IETF L4S meeting on Thursday? 
  
  - Show figures that show IP ECN/TCP ECN Flags being bleached/restored at different points?
  - Could also clarify the necessary behavior for ECN as well as L4S:
    - e.g., -- Do the IP ECN bits in the ToS field need to be preserved once ECN compliance has been established at the TCP level?

- Setup toy router in lab that correctly sets/obeys/implements L4S, and test sending L4S packets and non-L4S packets to get a sense of expected behavior?
  
  - Could also use a cloud box (e.g., EC2) to test how this behavior should look with higher latency (not if will have the correct permissions to set kernel stuff for networking however)

- Read over both Netalyzer and ZMap papers:
  
  - Which implementation would be most useful/interesting to a reader/the community?
    
    - ZMap seems possible/decently straightforward, can use existing scanning/packet sending functionality and then just create an output module/parser to measure data from the headers
      
      - With this, can mimic Bauer ECN readiness paper
    
    - Netalyzer paper -- closer to hackathon idea, consumer based testing of if their network supports L4S

- For "fallback" to Bauer paper:
  
  - Need rationale for revisiting
  
  - Tool checking for compatibility for multiple protocols
    
    - Presenting data similar to Netalyzer paper
