# Agenda

1. Show toy Go programs to send/set ToS/ECN bits

2. Do we need to use Go? Maybe instead use Scapy to setup TCP handshake, and see if ECN flag is set

3. Netrics Integration -- discussed with Kyle, gave me access to repo

### 4. Research Questions:

#### Email Idea: Surface Level L4S Readiness

* Measurement: At ECN compatible source, send ping to various endpoints using different routes, and see if the ECN 01/10 status persists (email idea) (**Concerns about novelty**)
  * Implementation:
    * Idea 1:
      * Implement similar nonce type idea as in Robust paper to identify if marks are removed/bleached, cascade checking of this status back to measurement host
        * Sender must mark ECN = ECT(1) (01): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id#section-4.1
        * Receiver must give L4S treatment to ECT(1) (01), or CE (11): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id#section-5.1
      * Gather *many* possible routes to various popular sites, for each route for each website, test if marks persist
      * If marks do not persist, record the offending gateway
    * **Problem: Novelty Problems? Because the L4S treatment uses ECN bits, this doesn't seem much different than just measuring the deployment of ECN**
      * Relevant paper about ^ published in IMC 2011: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2068816.2068833

#### More in-Depth, at scale L4S readiness

* Measurement: Take above idea one step further, come up with way to see if (1) the packet is marked for L4S, if it is actually placed in isolated queue, OR if (2) the packet is marked for L4S, and the router has some queue management (**This idea seems more novel**)
  * **Practicality -- is this possible?**
    * Measure RTT and see if falls within measured L4S preformance?
    * Is it possible to see if a router has queue management?
      * See if can get traffic placed in the queue, see if there's any preferential treatment for different markings
        * Should be the same if not supported, but faster for L4S if supported

#### Security/Measurement Angle: Dropping Classic Traffic in VPN Anti-Replay Configurations:

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id#section-6.2
  
  ```
  if the VPN egress is employing the optional anti-replay feature, it could
  inappropriately discard Classic packets (or discard the records in
  Classic packets) by mistaking their greater queuing delay for a
  replay attack
  ```

* https://github.com/heistp/l4s-tests/#tunneled-non-l4s-flows-not-protected-by-fq

* https://github.com/heistp/l4s-tests/#unsafety-in-shared-rfc3168-queues
  
  ```
  L4S flows dominate non-L4S flows in the same tunnel
  ```

* Rationale:
  
  * Mainly:  p_C = ( p_CL / k )^2, where p_C is the ECN marking probability for Classic ECN traffic (bottom: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled-23#section-2.1)
  * L4S expects a high volume of CE signals in order to be very sensitive/reactive to maintaining high performance on its queue
  * Specifically, it receives congestion signals both for its own queue, AND the CE signals and drops in the Classic ECN queue
  * In this way, the scheduler can serve the L4S queue with priority, because the L4S traffic isn't offering up enough traffic to use all the priority that it is given

* Measurement:
  
  * Configure optimal L4S setup (correct packet identifier/modified ECN, DualQ Coupled AQM), test passing traffic on L4S and Classic queues through different VPN services
    * Can measure performance of L4S in conjunction with VPNs
    * Can measure if different VPN services' anti-replay features cause the above issue
5. General/Outlook/Career Questions:
* Who decides when IETF drafts are ready for deployment? 
  * Any relevance to law school stuff?
* When to start thinking about plans for next summer? Internships?
  * Probably need to nail down more research direction first

# Notes

If L4S bit is set or cleared? **Special traceroute** -- returns packet header on each hop, can check here maybe

* Anything I should collect here? (e.g., at what host bleaching occurs, what host restores, number of hops ecn bits survive)

* After this, how to measure preservation at scale

* And then queueing behavior
  
  * Maybe can use the same stream
  * If identify paths that preserve marking:
    * For each hop, send n L4S marked packets and n non-L4S packets, measure cummulative time to receive replies back?

# TODO

Read into BBRv2

Finish reading into L4S AQM

Think of tr as vantage point, [map out where ECN bits are reset]([Usage &mdash; Scapy 2.4.5. documentation](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#tcp-traceroute-2))

* ^ Contribution, show/visualize where resets occur

* Gradient color coding, higher count maintaining ECN bits --> more green

Read Bauer paper, see if concepts/findings that we should revisit

* Conduct tests for maintaining ECN bit both on consumer/eyeball devices, and to Alexa top 1 million

* Measure the distribution of ECN persistence across different n number of hops from first and last hop

Read more -- mapping topologies w/ tr

* Don't assume hops are routers/route is what will be taken
